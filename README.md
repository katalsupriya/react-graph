Build Graph with React Js + MUI + Node JS

## Getting Started 

### How to run server and client app?

Note:- **Make sure you have latest version of Node js.**

1. First go inside server folder and run these commands in terminal :-
   - `npm i` 
   - `npm start`

2. You will see your server is running on this port (http://localhost:9000) 

3. How to check response data ?
   - Open this URL on your browser [`http://localhost:9000/get/candidates`]
   - If you are getting json data that means server is working. 

4. After your server runs on local, then go to client folder and again hit above commands.

5. Your local react app is now running on this port [`http://localhost:3000`]

Note:- **Please make sure your server is running** else you get a proxy error.
If you are still getting a proxy error, then close client app and again start client app with this command `npm start`.
